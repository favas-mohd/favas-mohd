## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I am Mohammed Favas CT, a final-year BCA student with a keen interest in software development. I am currently working on innovative projects like an automated attendance system using face recognition and a hostel management system. Passionate about technology, I aim to leverage my skills in Python, php, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java to create impactful solutions.
